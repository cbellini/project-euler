# Project Euler

## Overview
My Project Euler problem solutions, just for fun.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

From the directory that the repo is cloned to, install modules

```sh
npm install
```

### Running the problems

The problems can be run from the src folder on the command line by supplying problem number and input parameters as arguments. For example, running the 4th problem supplying "foo" and "bar" as input parameters is accomplished by:

```sh
node index -p 04 -i foo,bar
```

### Running the tests
Unit tests can be run from the root project folder:

```sh
npm test
```
